## Setup MongoDB

Please check the [MongoDB installation documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) to install MongoDB on your own local machine for testing


## Exporting and Importing MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB CLI tools are installed. Run `npm run dump` to export datastore, and run `npm run restore` to import. The git repo already contains mock data from Samuel's computer, so for most people, just run the restore script.


## Getting Started

Make sure your MongoDB server is running

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
